# EyemWatchingYou
A neat little tool - a pair of eyes follows your mouse cursor as it moves around the screen.
This tool works automatically as long as all files are loaded.
Simply move your cursor around the webpage and the eyes will follow you around.
Future fixes: I'd like too add an option to change the eye colors. Maybe someone smarter than me could add a function to make the eyes blink or fall asleep if your cursor remains still for too long!
